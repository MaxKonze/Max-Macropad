# Max-Macropad

My Hackpad has 7 keys. 6 of those keys are macros, while the 7. key is to change between two layers. I also used a rotary encoder with a switch to change the volume.

## Features:
- 7 Keys + a switch in the rotary encoder
- 1 rotary encoder
- 2 Neopixels as status lights
- 2 Part Case
- XIAO RP20240
